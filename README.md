# Flight Search Breakable Toy
Hey, Everyone this is a Breakable Toy I made for the Spark Program in Encora!!

The instructions to run this are these:

You need to have Node.js and IntelliJ (or some IDE that runs a Java Compiler and Java) for test of this project

1. You got to install all the dependencies from the flightsearch-breakabletoy carpet. You'll do this by using a terminal with the folder of the project open and procede to type this command: npm install
2. then you'll run the 'FlightSearchBreakableToyApplication.java' archive from IntelliJ (or Equivalent)
3. Then you'll type the next command for running the flightsearch-breakabletoy (from the terminal): npm run start

If you do this correctly then the project will be functioning correctly and open a port from your default search engine and you'll see the application running.

To stop the process in the terminal you'll need to type the left control (or Ctrl) and the C letter, and the program should stop running. To stop the Back-end you'll only need to stop the project from the IDE. And that should be it.
